## `package` 包

<br>

A `package` is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces. 

Conceptually you can think of packages as being similar to different folders on your computer. You might keep HTML pages in one folder, images in another, and scripts or applications in yet another. 

Because **software written in the Java programming language can be composed of hundreds or thousands of individual classes, it makes sense to keep things organized by placing related classes and interfaces into packages.**

用Java语言编写的软件会由成百上千的独立的类组成，把相关的包和接口有组织地整理放进包里，这样做很有意义。

<br>

## API

<br>

The Java platform provides an enormous class library (a set of packages) suitable for use in your own applications. This library is known as the **"Application Programming Interface", or "API"** for short. Its packages represent the tasks most commonly associated with general-purpose programming. 

**Java平台提供一个巨大的类库（很多包的集），适配应用的使用过程。这个类库就是API，这些包展现了十分广泛的通用化编程任务。**

<br>

For example, a String object contains state and behavior for character strings; a File object allows a programmer to easily create, delete, inspect, compare, or modify a file on the filesystem; 
a Socket object allows for the creation and use of network sockets; various GUI objects control buttons and check boxes and anything else related to graphical user interfaces. 
There are literally thousands of classes to choose from. 
This allows you, the programmer, to focus on the design of your particular application, rather than the infrastructure required to make it work.

<br>

**The Java Platform API Specification contains the complete listing for all packages, interfaces, classes, fields, and methods supplied by the Java SE platform.** 

**Java API 包含了Java SE平台下完整的包、接口、类、字段和方法的清单列表。**
